                        <p>John Smith's barbershop was started as a hobbyist's passion, which turned into a business almost by accident.</p> <br />

                        <p>Mr. Smith developed an interest in traditional wet shaving through a series of personal circumstances, most notably the fact that he was struggnling to find a way to maintain a clean shaved face, without suffering from severe facial
                            irritation. He bagan reseraching online - simply Googling - about men with facial skin problems from shaving and trying to find solutions. This led him to various forums, bloggers and YouTubers who were pushing for traditional
                            wet shaving with a single-blade safety razor. John discovered that cartridge blades and ordinary shaving foams and gels were made very cheaply and contained multiple chemical igredients, which are generally bad for the face,
                            but especially damaging for people with sensitive skin. Not long after, he started experimenting with shaving creams and shaving soaps, which required him to use a shaving brush for the creation of lather. It all seemed a bit
                            too fancy at first, but after a few shaves the results were quite visible - John's face had drastically improved! He immediately ordered a single blade safety razor and an alcohol splash type of aftershave (post-shave), as
                            opposed to the balm creams.</p> <br />
                        <p>Traditional wet shaving became his hobby; John began experimenting with various shaving products - predominantly shaving soaps - and focused especially on small artisan companies from different nations - Italy, Germany, France,
                            the United States, Scotland, etc. His friends noticed the results and began asking him, curious not only about his new, fixed facial skin, but also about the new varietes of fragrances that odoured from his skin. Johh passionatelly
                            explained to them in detail about his journey into researching traditional wet shaving and how he stumbled upon and endless variety of artisan shaving produtcs. It wasn't long before one of his buddies had suggested, over a
                            pint of lager at the local pub, that Smith should also consider expanding his skills to men's haircuts. After some laughs and some contemplation, John decided to experiment cutting the hair of two of his buddies - it was all
                            a joke at first, but, despite the fact that the haircuts were quite basic, the results were somewhat impressive for a complete amateur, considering that his only knowledge about men's haircuts was from a few articles and two
                            YouTube videos. Needless to say, his mates were impressed and they suggested that he should undero a barber course either in college or through one of the various private companies who provide such training. The prices were
                            reasonable and John did have some savings so he thought that he should give it a shot. He was amongst the highest scoring graduates and was able to find a job at a local barbershop only two weeks after finishing the course.
                        </p> <br />
                        <p>After 7 months of work, he felt he had enough experience as a barber and left his place of employment for one reason and one reasona alone - to open his very own barbershop. He had saved up money from his employment as a barber
                            and rented a medium-sized place, which had previously been a dry cleaner's shop. He repaired some minor faults, painted it, bought furniture and barber's equipment and made it as aesthetically beautiful and old school as he
                            possibly could. Business did not start well at first - the bulk of his customers were his relatvies, friends and their relatives, but his hard work and his superb skills started started showing results and his client number
                            grew, to the point where the business was not only self-sustainable, but was also making good profits, with a steady increasement. His success allowed him to hire two more barbers as his employees - one of whom is one of his
                            buddies who, inspired by John's success, also graduted a barber course.Needless to say, his mates were impressed and they suggested that he should undero a barber course either in college or through one of the various private
                            companies who provide such training. The prices were reasonable and John did have some savings so he thought that he should give it a shot. He was amongst the highest scoring graduates and was able to find a job at a local
                            barbershop only two weeks after finishing the course.</p> <br />

                        <br />
                        <p>And this is where our business currently stands. John Smith's barbershop is not just a place where a man gets his hair cut - it is a place of art and tradition. It is a place where our hard work makes you enjoy getting your hair
                            cut and your beard shaved with a straight razor. We turn this experience for you from a chore into a relaxing, enjoyable event that you dedicate to yourself once every two-three weeks.</p>
